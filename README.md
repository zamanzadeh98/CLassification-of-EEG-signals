# CLassification-of-EEG-signals

**This repo is under process**!

# Aim
Hello every one!

In this repo I aim to both learn how to analyse EEG signals and classify participants having either Alzheimer's disease (AD group: 36 participants), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD group: 23 participants). Also, we have 29 healthy subjects (CN group)!

# Data
Where to find the dataset: [link](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004504/versions/1.0.6)

# Notebooks
* `dataPreprocess.ipynb`: In this notebook, I have tried preprocessing, segmenting the dataset. Also, the results are saved in a HDF5 file (using h5py packages). This saving format is so efficient when working with large dataset. Hope you find it useful.

* `Tutorial 1.ipynb`: This notebook is so fun. I have been trying to implement various signal processing algorithms.

To be continued...!
